Thermia is an in-depth, dynamic temperature system with heavy integrations
into vanilla content and features and a big focus on being fun for the player,
rather than being unnecessarily difficult. The mod was mainly created as an alternative
to famous temperature systems like Tough as Nails, and takes some inspiration from games like
**Don't Starve Together** and **Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild**.

## Main Features

Temperature is a new core mechanic that the player will have to interact with at every turn.
Most mechanics in the base game interact with temperature in some way, Here are some examples
of factors that influence your temperature:

- Climate; your biome, the sun's current position, and the surrounding blocks.
- Inventory; your held items, equipment items, and active enchantments.
- Certain damage types can even push mobs closer to freezing or burning!

Be careful not to let your temperature get too low. Lower temperatures can result in hypothermia,
slowing you down and damaging you over time. Similarly, higher temperatures may result in hyperthermia,
which damages you and removes your ability to sprint. You must use suitable blocks, items, and
equipment to combat extreme climates like the Nether!

Similarly to my mod [Unbreakable](https://modrinth.com/mod/durability-rework), this mod is highly customizable.
Currently, customization is only supported through datapacks and resource packs, but a config is planned.
